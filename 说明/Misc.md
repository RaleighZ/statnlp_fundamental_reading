# Misc
- Materials, like notes, other reading materials and etc., for each reading class should be stored separately: one folder for one class. 
- If you want to insert math equations in GitHub markdown, you may follow following steps：
  - Type in latex code for math equations in  https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php
  - Select output format as url in the bottom part of the webpage to generate the url link for math equations
    - For example, after you type in 'f(x) = sin(x)' in the input box and select the url format, the webpage will automatically output https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(x)=\sin(x)
  - Return to markdown file, and input "![] (url link)" to the place where you want to insert the math equations, and url link is the link you obtain from https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php previously.
  - Example: Insert f(x) = sin(x), what you get： ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(x)=\sin(x))
