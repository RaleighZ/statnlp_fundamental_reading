## Background
Q1: Why we choose Neural Networks(NNs) as tools for NLP

## Concept:
- [Bag of Words (BoW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model)
	- The **bag-of-words model** is a simplifying **representation** for texts (document, sentence and etc.)
	- Representing a piece of text by the words and their frequency in the text.
- Neural Networks
- [Inductive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias)
	- The **inductive bias** (also known as **learning bias**) of a [learning algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_algorithm "Learning algorithm") is the set of assumptions that the learner uses to predict outputs given inputs that it has not encountered.

## Language (Processing) is Hard
- So many things to handle
	- Syntax: structure of sentence
	- Semantic/Knowledge: meanging from the sentence
	- Morphology: construction of words
	- Discourse: beyond single sentence
	- Pragmatics:  meaning in the interactional context
	- etc.

## Why NNs are more powerful
Text classification as an Example
- BOW
- Deep NN Models:
	- Allow sophiscated feature combination

## Things to Remember
- NNs are powerful
	- Universal approximator
- Language is hard and data is limited
	- we need to introduce inductive bias to make designed network learn easier
