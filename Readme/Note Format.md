# NOTE Format
## Content
### Purpose/Motivation (3-5 min <sup>1</sup>)
You may include 'What kind of problems can this topic/task address' (you'd better give descriptions in details, with which we can easily associate it with related tasks)
- For example, the language model is proposed to calculate/assign a probability to a given sentenceï¼Œor predict a possible next word over a word sequence. We can apply the language model to machine translation ...

### Definition of Problem (5-7 min)
The description of the task in details. You may include the formal description/definition of problems and it would be better to show it in rigid mathematical forms.
- For example, what is the format of input and what is expected to output from the model in the parsing task.

### Definition of Concept (10-20 min)
In this part, you may cover the critical concepts which are important to the following teaching. Meanwhile, it would better for you to set up some quizzes or Q&A sessions to test whether listeners have already mastered the concepts. Specifically, you can:
- Write some problems related to the concepts
- Leave some time to the listens when they can ask questions about these concepts.

What are the critical concepts?
- Critical concepts maybe those concepts, without which listeners may get confused about the contents you teach. For example, you may mention Markov property and some information theory concepts, like entropy, cross entropy and etc., when you teach language model. If you introduce those concepts in advance, listeners may get confused about the definition of the probability of an LM. 


### Conventional Methods (30-35min)
You may include the details of the model/algorithms of conventional methods that address the aforementioned problems.
You'd better set up Q&A sessions as mentioned before. 

### State-of-the-art(SoTA) Methods (30-35min)
In this part, you may include some typical, need-to-read SoTA models on this topic. 
What should be covered when presenting SoTA models?
- Motivation
- Methods
- Some aspects deserve sharing (in your opinion)
- Some problems or questions you find when you read those papers and  deserve discussing (in your opinion)

## Remarks
1: The time length here refers to the suggested time length for teaching. The writer of the note can take this time as a reference for the amount of content you prepare in this part. (The purpose of the time is the same in following parts)
